Based on the provided files, here is the explanation for the incorrect day and hour results:

The root cause of the error lies in the incorrect handling of timezones within the `ganzhi_day` method in `data/lunisolar_v2.py`. This initial error then cascades, causing the subsequent error in the hour calculation.

### 1. Incorrect Day Calculation (`ganzhi_day`)

The `SexagenaryEngine.ganzhi_day` method is responsible for calculating the day's Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch. The logic is flawed in how it determines the date from the input datetime object.

-   **The Flaw:** The method receives a timezone-aware datetime object for the local time (CST, UTC+8). However, it immediately strips this crucial timezone information by calling `.replace(tzinfo=None)`.

    ```python
    # from data/lunisolar_v2.py in SexagenaryEngine.ganzhi_day
    if target_local.tzinfo is not None:
        target_date = target_local.replace(tzinfo=None) # This line is the error
    ```

-   **Why It's Wrong:** The sexagenary day cycle is a continuous count. To correctly calculate the number of days that have passed since a fixed historical anchor, all calculations must be based on a single, consistent timezone. By stripping the timezone, the code treats the local time (e.g., `2025-10-08 11:00`) as a generic, timezone-naive value. This leads to off-by-one errors, because a date in one timezone can still be the previous date in another (e.g., early morning in CST is still the previous day in UTC).

-   **The Result:** This incorrect handling causes the day count to be miscalculated, resulting in the wrong Stem-Branch pair: `辛亥 (xīnhài)` instead of the correct `庚戌 (gengxu)`.

### 2. Incorrect Hour Calculation (`ganzhi_hour`)

The error in the day calculation directly causes the error in the hour calculation.

-   **The Dependency:** The `ganzhi_hour` method uses a rule called "Wu Shu Dun" (五鼠遁) to find the hour's Heavenly Stem. This rule's output depends entirely on the Heavenly Stem of the *day*.

-   **Cascading Error:** Since the `ganzhi_day` method produced an incorrect day stem (`辛` instead of `庚`), this wrong value was fed into the `ganzhi_hour` calculation. This inevitably produced the incorrect hour stem (`甲` instead of `壬`).

-   **Why the Branch was Correct:** The hour's Earthly Branch (e.g., `午` for 11:00-13:00) only depends on the time of day, not the day's stem. The input time (`11:00`) was correct, so the hour branch was calculated correctly, even while the stem was wrong.

In summary, the core issue is a timezone-handling bug in the day calculation, which produces an incorrect day stem. This error then flows downstream, causing the hour stem calculation to also be incorrect.
