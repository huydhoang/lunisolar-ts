Astronomical Data Pipeline (Python)

Overview
- This pipeline performs high-precision astronomical calculations using NASA JPL DE440 ephemeris data and writes optimized, chunked JSON outputs for consumption by the TypeScript package.
- Currently implemented datasets in the orchestrator: lunar phases (new/full moons) and solar terms.
- Additional calculators exist in this repository but are not generated by the current orchestrator run.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies listed in the project root requirements.txt:
  - skyfield
  - pytz
  - rich
  - InquirerPy

Install Dependencies
1) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     - python -m venv .venv
     - .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
2) Install packages
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Pipeline
- Generate lunar phases and solar terms for a date range (non-interactive):
  - python data/main.py --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-12-31

Production Data Generation
- For Phase 1, generate a comprehensive range (e.g., 1900â€“2100). Note that this can take significant time and disk space:
  - python data/main.py --start-date 1900-01-01 --end-date 2100-12-31

Output Structure
- JSON files are chunked by year and written under output/json/<data_type>/<year>.json
  - output/json/new_moons/2025.json       // array of Unix timestamps
  - output/json/full_moons/2025.json      // array of Unix timestamps
  - output/json/solar_terms/2025.json     // array of [timestamp, index]

Notes
- The orchestrator uses parallel processing. For very large ranges, consider running overnight.
- The TypeScript package will load these JSON chunks lazily by year for optimal performance.
